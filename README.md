# Showwcase Take Home Project
Here's my take home project for the Showwcase SWE internship!

**Disclaimer:** For the deployed Vercel app, it doesn't run the university search API correctly because of the mixed content between HTTPS and HTTP. Everything works completely fine running locally though!

## Project setup & run
Install all dependencies:
`npm install`

Run project:
`npm start`
